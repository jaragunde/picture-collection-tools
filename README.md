# Picture Collection Tools

This repository contains Python scripts to help you manage and visualize your picture collection.

## Scripts

Disclaimer: These scripts were generated by AI and reviewed by a human.

### 1. `index_pictures.py`

This script recursively scans a directory for image files and indexes their metadata (path, size, and date taken) into an SQLite database.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 index_pictures.py /path/to/your/pictures
```

This will create a `.collection.db` file in the specified directory.

### 2. `plot_growth.py`

This script reads the `.collection.db` file created by the indexer and generates charts showing the size of your collection over time.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 plot_growth.py /path/to/your/pictures
```

**Outputs:**
- `collection_growth.png`: A bar chart showing the cumulative size of the collection over time.
- `collection_monthly_size.png`: A bar chart showing the total size of pictures taken in each month.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `Pillow` (for EXIF data extraction)
- `matplotlib` (for chart generation)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install Pillow matplotlib
```
